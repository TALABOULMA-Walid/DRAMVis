DRAMVis: a visualization and comparison tool for DRAMSim2

This visualization tool is written in C# and runs on mono. You'll probably want
to install the mono libraries and monodevelop. We've included the project files
for monodevelop and the NPlot.dll is used to draw the graphs. 

This code is probably quite messy at this point, but it should work.
